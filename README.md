I like making notes, and personally, I think my notes are pretty good, so this is mainly a way for me to consolidate said notes (from (almost) all the classes I've taken so far at CMU) and share them with anyone who may want to see them.

Hopefully I don't violate any course policies ;-;

And of courses, all credits/etc go to the Profs who taught those classes.
